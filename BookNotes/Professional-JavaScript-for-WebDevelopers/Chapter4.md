variables in JavaScript is loosely typed



Primitive types: Undefined, Null, Boolean, Number, String and Symbol. These variables are said to be accessed by value, because you are manipulating the actual value stored in the variable.



Reference values are objects stored in memory. When manipulating an object, you are really working on a `reference` to that object rather than the actual object itself. Such values are said to be `accessed by reference`
