# Chapter 1 Computer Networks and the Internet



End Systems are connected together by a network of **communication links** and **packet swicthes**. There are different types of physical media, including coxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber and radio spectrum.



**Socket interface**: specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system.



**Network Protocol**: All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol. A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the tranmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.



**edge router**: The network that physically connects an end system to the first router on a path from the end system to any other distant end system.



**Cable internet**: external device and connects to the home PC through an Ethernet port. At the cable head end, the cable modem termination system (CMTS) serves a similar function as the DSL network's DSLAM turning the analog signal sent from the cable modems in many downstream home back into digital format. ***Shared broadcast medium*** (if multiple users are simultanously download a video file, the actual rate will be lower than downstream rate.)

- Downstream bitrates of 40 Mbps and 1.2 Gbps
- Upstream rates of 30 Mbps and 100 Mbps.
