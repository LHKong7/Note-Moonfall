# Lists



*A list, structurally, is composed of a list container element filled with list items.* 



There are three types of lists:

- Unordered list: `<ul>` & `<li>`
- Ordered list: `<ol>` & `<li>`
- description lists: `<dl>` & `<dt> & <dd>>`





**list-style-position**: allows you to move your bullet point to either `inside` or `outside` the list-item's contents.

**list-style-image**: allows you to replace your list's bullet points with images.

**list-style-type**:  changes the bullet points to known style keywords, custom strings, emojis and more.



##### ::marker pseudo

The `list-item` marker element is the bullet, hyphen, or roman numeral that helps indicate each item in your list.
