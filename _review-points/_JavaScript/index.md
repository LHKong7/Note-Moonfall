# JavaScript rewiew knowledge





### Variables Scope Memory



##### Dynamic Properties

Dynamic properties only added into object, The instantiation of a primitive type can be accomplished using only the primitive literal form. If using the `new` keyword, JS will create an Object type.

###### Copying values

When a prmitive value is assigned from one variable to another, the value stored on the variable object is created and copied into the location for the new variable.

When a reference value is assigned from one variable to another, the value stored on the variable object is also copied into the location for the new variable.



##### Argument passing

If the value is primitive, then it acts like a primitive variable copy.

If the value is reference, it acts just like a reference variable copy.

variables are accessed by both value and by reference, but arguments are passed only by value.
