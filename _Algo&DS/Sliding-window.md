### Sliding Window



A **window** is formed over some part of data, and this window can slide over the data to capture different portions of it.



any problem where the problem looking for:

1. Minimum value
2. Maximum value
3. Longest value
4. Shortest value
5. K-sized value

The problem will be based on an array, list, or string type of data structure.

It will ask to find subrange in that array or string will have to give longest, shortest, or target values.

Its concept is mainly based on ideas like the longest sequence or shortest sequence of something that satifies a given condition perfectly.



some basic steps to solve problems related to the sliding window technique:

- Take hashmap or dictionary to count specific array input and uphold on increasing the window towards right using an outer look
- Take one inside a loop to reduce the window side by sliding towards the right. This loop will be very short
- Store the current maximum or minimum window size or count based on the problem statement.
